# ZXRemakerTools
A handful of code created by me while developing ZX81/ZX Spectrum BASIC game listing "remakes" in Python.  Any updates or new tools will
be added to this repository over time.  So if you're a child of the 80's, sit back and enjoy that nostalgiac journey back to when life
was great and computing was for nerds.
## The back story...
As a child I learnt to code through typing in hundreds of software listings (in BASIC) found in books and magazines.  Through
experimentation and tweaking of the code and graphics, I (and the many other kids of that era) quickly picked up those skills needed
to start developing our own games.

I believe that learning through games and experimenting with others code can be a creative and exciting experience.  Today, Python
offers an easy-to-learn language that is a lot of fun to work with and very powerful.  While BASIC and Python are different, problem
solving and computational thinking is the same no matter what language you are using.  Translating BASIC to Python is easy when you
understand the fundamentals of programming.

You can read about my BASIC project on my blog.

# Python and external modules
The scripts were developed in python 2.7.6, and external modules you will need when working with these scripts are:

## Python Imaging Library (1.1.7)
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

## pygame (1.9.1)
http://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

# More soon...
I'll extend this read me with more information as I go.
